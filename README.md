# Meteorita

An app created to allow users to search meteorite strikes.

Created as part of Chingu's voyage-9 prework (tier 3).

## Requirements

Create an application that provides users with the ability to explore meteorite strikes across the globe by searching the [Meteorite Landing dataset](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh) on the Nasa Open Data Portal.

This application should allow you to:
- Meteorite landings are displayed in alphabetical order on the name of the landing location. 
- Users may scroll through the list of landings, or use the search box to search for a names that include the entered search term. 
- Searches are case independent. This means the user may type searches in lower, upper, or mixed case (like Case, case, or cASe) and the same results will be returned.
- The results list can be reset to its original contents by clearing the search box and clicking the 'Search' button.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
